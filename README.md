## Project Title:
"Comparing Python and R for Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning techniques."
## Project aim
This project aims to compare Python and R as used technologies for Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning techniques (logistic regression, KNN, SVM and decision trees). Our goal was to create a project in Python, reproduce it using R and compare strengths and weaknesses of both technologies. 

Both files .r and .py include data inspection, ETL process, data analysis with ML techniques and comparison using Log Accuracy, Log Recall, Log Precision and Log ROC AUC metrics.
## Dataset
For the project we have used this data set https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranadeep/credit-risk-dataset?resource=download, as explained in files we had to introduce extensive ETL process for handling missing values, highly correlated values and values without that did not make sense for our project.
## Results and conclusions 
We have found pros and cons of using both technologies for this project.
On one hand Python is a highly versatile language with a wide range of libraries and frameworks, it  has gained popularity as a go-to language for Machine Learning tasks.
It provides a rich ecosystem of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn that facilitate data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
Additionally we were able to find lot of materials and guidelines for performing the analysis efficiently.
On the other hand R was specifically designed for statistical analysis and data manipulation, which was helpful during the ETL process.
But even though R in some parts have a more intuitive syntax and functions specifically designed for working with structured data, our technology of choice is Python.
Python integration with other tools and frameworks that are commonly used in the machine learning and data science domain,
such as TensorFlow and PyTorch allows to leverage the power of deep learning and neural networks for credit risk analysis.
